##Special Role of English
English(code '_en_') has a special role in the Translator app. It is the base language.

Developers use this language to create the initial translations from which everyone else works.

Translations with code '_en_' cannot be edited or deleted other than by developers.

If you wish to have an English translation different from English(_en_) then an administrator can make a variant of English by using using the deep copy method. 

A variant would normally be named by adding a country code to _en_. For example a variant with American spellings would be named _en-US_.

Using a country code is not required. You could call it by the name of your centre eg '_en-DHAMMA-RASMI_'. If you do something like this remember than after that you will have to maintain it with new translations. **Having individual translations like en-DHAMMA-RASMI is NOT recommended**.
