##Prerequisites
####Your operating system doesn't matter.
####Your Browser DOES Matter
>> <div style= "font-weight:700;color:red;">Do Not use Internet Explorer with Vipassana Translator. It will not work properly.</div>
>> There are many other free browsers that you can use.

- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari (with mac)

>>All of the above will work well with Vipassana Translator. Download and translate away.
>> N.B. The new Microsoft Edge browser has not been tested with Vipassana Translator. We recommend not to use it for now as it may not give consistent results.
